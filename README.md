# django-svelte-vite-template

This project is a sample on how to integrate django, vite and svelte into one, all-powerful megazord.

Please take your time to read [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lucianoratamero/7fc9737d24229ea9219f0987272896a2) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCyYIVfDkhY) to understand how things are working, and how to reconfigure everything to your needs. :]

As usual, this is more of a proof of concept than a proper boilerplate, so be free to add issues, so we can learn more together!

## Installing

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the python dependencies. So, first, install poetry, then clone this repo, create a virtualenv for it, and install the dependencies with `poetry install`.

After that, you'll need run `npm install`, to install the node dependencies.

With all done, migrate the database and run `npm run dev`. This npm script will run both servers in parallel, giving you a straightforward dev server (on :8000 by default).

## Contributing / Code of Conduct

I'd love to know more about your specific use cases, or better solutions for the problem, so be free to open issues and discuss on the ones that are open!

The only thing that I ask is for you to be mindful of others. That means non-agressive communication. That means no racism, homophobia, etc. Please, and thank you :]
